   	<h2>Who Am I?</h2>
      <p>Growing up I have always had a extra large family. My name is Liz Murdock, I was born and raised in New Jersey. I am the youngest of 13, and yes we are all blood related.
        I have 6 brothers and 6 sisters. When I was very young my mother passed away and my father could no longer support such a large family on his own. So, my aunt and uncle stepped in 
        and adopted us younger kids. While the older siblings were foster by our other aunt and uncle. Having such a large family has always been a blessing and a challenge. But I wouldn't change it for the world.
        I am now in my early 20's and in college studying Business Communications. I love meeting new people and learning effective ways to communicate with others. I also have a passion for the arts, music,
        paddle boarding, and traveling.

    <h2>My Adoption</h2>
      <p>I was only 5 years old when my aunt Stacy and uncle Darrow took me in. I dont remember much, but I do remember recieving so much love. They always made it known that they cared and loved us.
        When I first was adopted I remember asking my uncle if I should call him dad. He encouraged me to contiue to refer to him as my uncle because he never wants to replace my father. That was so 
        special to me, since I was so young.

    <h2>What My Family Means to Me</h2>
      <p> My family is loud, crazy, and the house is filled with laughter. Without my family I wouldn't be the person I am today. I am so blessed to have been adopted into my family because it means that I never had to grow up without them.
        My family is my support system, I know I can fall back on them when life gets hard. They are my biggest cheerleaders
